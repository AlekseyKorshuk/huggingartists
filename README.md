## Results

There are some interesting lyrics. Contact me to add your results:

#### Eminem:
~~~
I am a bit of a nutter
Like a fucking crazy nut
But I just wanted to break and get a little more serious, so be patient
I dont think I need no medical attention
But I do know that these niggas gonna be in my prayers
And they say Im a nutter
Like a fucking crazy nut
But I love you
I am a nutter
Like a fuckin nutter
But I feel like the greatest that I can be
With your body and your spirits
But I dont know how I will act
When I finally get out
And I get pissed off
Ill be right back at ya with the first one on the floor
But I aint ever gonna get the respect youve been getting
And Im a nutter
~~~

#### Drake:
~~~
I am what they say I am
In a barroom brawlin
Youre never gonna get me up like Jada Pinkett
So this what they call me
Livin a fight while Im sippin on Hennessy
My name is Kala Brown, I need a new name
Cause I dont live a bitch
Dont play the same shit I did before
I dont lie and nobody wanna know
I got a little group on my shoulders to save
I want to be a man but I gotta do a lot of things to get me there
So get over yourself, get over yourselves
Its like you and I dont care how we do it
But youll get there when you get there
Cause it feels good to be me
Cause I know
~~~
