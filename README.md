### [ðŸš€ Run the demo notebook to train](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists/blob/master/huggingartists-demo.ipynb)
### [ðŸš€ Run the GUI demo to test](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists)

_Disclaimer: this project is not to be used to publish any false generated information or unpleasant words but to perform research on Natural Language Generation._

## How to use

Just to generate without training, use [Spaces with Streamlit](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists).
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists)

#### Eminem:
~~~
I am a bit of a nutter
Like a fucking crazy nut
But I just wanted to break and get a little more serious, so be patient
I dont think I need no medical attention
But I do know that these niggas gonna be in my prayers
And they say Im a nutter
Like a fucking crazy nut
But I love you
I am a nutter
Like a fuckin nutter
But I feel like the greatest that I can be
With your body and your spirits
But I dont know how I will act
When I finally get out
And I get pissed off
Ill be right back at ya with the first one on the floor
But I aint ever gonna get the respect youve been getting
And Im a nutter...

I am bipolar while Iâ€™m rhyming, bipolar while I am hate
When Iâ€™m rhyming, I may seem a little bit crazy
But the thingâ€™s with these rhymes that I pick
I stick to the syllable Ã§ unless itâ€™s on a syllable
Bread is full of charmin I am thinkin all of the garbage
Hear the bass line and ya hear the bass line
But hip hop is what makesâ€™em songs
I try to describe how Iâ€™m gettinâ€™ em all, but Iâ€™m lazy
When Iâ€™m rapin on a song, Iâ€™m just making it
If I donâ€™t got the right, In my mind...

#### Drake:
~~~
I am never livin the life that I never lived
I walk around with my Glock 9
And lay down with my feet up
This is my house, bitch
Welcome to Detroit, this is my city
Ive made it all my people proud
I even sold my house down
To get a possible placement as a burnt pit
My little girl, she should ntroller
Wanna flip sometimes on the upside
But its hard to hold a grudge, I dont bite
I say my wholehearted, prayer is my heart
I pray for you when Im gone, but I gotta leave you in peace
That we did not plan to be seeing each other, well
We did plan to be seeing each other, well
And if you ever need anything, I...
